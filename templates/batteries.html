        TThe addition of electrical drivetrain immediately imposed a risk to the project cost. Electric motors and
        control electronics proved to be reasonably priced for their performance, but batteries are still a field of
        development on a global scale and a far more expensive addition. The best cost/benefit option was found to be
        the Lithium polymer technology with high discharge rate of 8C and charge rate of 3C. The amount of batteries was
        reduced to an extent by the flywheel addition and thus a lump of money saved. Total weight of the batteries is
        38kg with a nominal voltage of 62V and total capacity of 60Ah. This gives a safe output rate of 480A and
        regenerative current of 180A. A further 200A can be regenerated by diversion towards the flywheel
        motor/generator also running at 62V.
        Battery Management System or BMS is important for the safe and optimal performance of the battery pack. The main
        purpose of the BMS is to protect the pack from over and under voltage conditions as well as imbalance between
        the cells during operation and charging.
